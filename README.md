# 🔮 FluxBound 🔮

**FluxBound** is a turn-based, elemental card battle game inspired by *Elements The Game*, rebuilt from the ground up with modern web tech and a strong focus on clear systems, determinism, and extensibility.

This project explores a clean separation between **game logic**, **effect resolution**, and **rendering**, with the long-term goal of becoming a fully playable, moddable, browser-based card game.

## ✨ Core Ideas
